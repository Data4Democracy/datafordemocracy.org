project_descriptions:
  - Data for Democracy is building <b>Insight Lane</b> - a volunteer project to help cities in their mission to build safer roads, by combining open data with the power of data science.
  - Insight Lane achieves this goal in 3 ways&#58;
  - 1. Identifying high risk locations
  - 2. Understanding the contributing factors of risk
  - 3. Assessing the impact of intervetion
  - Any city in the world can participate. Our <a href=Insight Lane&#58; The D4D Crash Model"https://github.com/Data4Democracy/crash-model/releases">latest release</a> builds predictions based on historical crash data, road features and citizen-reported safety concerns, but this is only the beginning - traffic volumes, average speeds, construction events, weather and more can all help understand what creates risk on roads.
  - We're interested in speaking with any city that shares our vision for improving road safety. As more cities become involved and the depth of data increases we're looking to unlock the potential of shared insights, in a way that allows for true collaboration on a global problem, rather than siloed, single-city efforts.
