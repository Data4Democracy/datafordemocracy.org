#Numbers 

The numbers speak for themselves. Our experiment that started in December 2016 has grown into an inclusive community of hundreds of active volunteers around the world, collaborating on mission-driven technology with impact. As of February 2017, there are over 700 technologists in this organization, communicating through more than 4,000 Slack messages weekly, and making nearly 500 commits a week across 28 GitHub repositories.

#What We Can Do

Data for Democracy is an inclusive community for data scientists and technologists. We do data engineering, machine learning, data analysis, data visualization, software engineering, community management, storytelling, and more! Whether you are an experienced data scientist looking for a side project, an enthusiast looking to develop your skills, 
or just trying to find a way to help, Data for Democracy is the place for you! There is no skill set or experience level to join - just the passion for making a positive impact on communities who need our help.

Here, you will find a space for like-minded people to organize, to transform, to collaborate, and to support each other's projects. We help each other track down datasets, refine models, improve visualizations, team up on apps, debug code, promote work, and connect with communities who need our analysis.
