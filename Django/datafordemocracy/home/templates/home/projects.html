                    Our active projects are focused on understanding the behavior of online communities,
                    election transparency, a USA dashboard (like KPIs for America), analysis on the extreme right,
                    Medicare drug spending, and campaign spending (in support of work by ProPublica). These projects
                    are all self-organized and community led. We’re also talking with a few US cities about more formal
                    partnerships, and a couple of international NGOs about partnering on projects that don’t have a US
                    focus.

                    Community working to build tools and infrastructure to enable the study of online communities and
                    their characteristics. As we work through our own projects, our goal is to build a toolkit which
                    takes care of common tasks so researchers do not have to reinvent the wheel with each new project.
                    To be an inclusive community for data scientists and technologists to volunteer and collaborate

                </h2><br>
                <p><b>Project Description:</b>
                    This is an official collaboration between the City of Boston’s Analytics Team and Data for Democracy.
                    We want to build a crash prediction modeling application. This would combine things like
                    <a href="http://app01.cityofboston.gov/VZSafety/">our crowdsourced safety concerns dataset</a>
                    and
                    <a href="http://app01.cityofboston.gov/VisionZero/">crash reports</a>
                    with a wide range of other data from our own
                    open data portal as well as from other sources like the state’s transportation and transit agencies,
                    weather conditions feeds, and traffic reports from sites like Google. The end result will be a set of
                    dynamic predictions we can use to identify potential trouble spots and direct timely safety
                    interventions–everything from protected bike lanes and better-marked crosswalks to new street
                    lights and traffic light timings. We’ll make this publicly-available to everyone through a hosted
                    map application, and develop the project as an open source template that can be adapted for use by
                    other cities.

                    Help the public understand what their tax dollars are going toward. Eg, what % of the eligible
                    population (and/or all Americans) are benefiting from Medicare prescription drug coverage? How many
                    Medicare enrollees are being treated for common/relatable conditions like diabetes, Alzheimer’s, or
                    depression? What proportion of Medicare prescription spending is on each of those conditions?
