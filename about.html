      <h3>Our mission</h3>
      <p>Data for Democracy brings together an active, passionate community of people using data to drive better decisions and improve the world in which we live.</p>
    </div>
    <div class='twelve columns'>
    <h3>Our story</h3>
      <p>Data for Democracy began as an experiment in December 2016, when people from around the world began to collaborate on data-related problems solely through Slack messages and GitHub commits. With no rules or formal organizational structure, the focus was on getting real and impactful work done with minimal delay.</p>
      <p>As of September 2017, the community is based on Slack and <a href="https://github.com/data4democracy" >GitHub</a>. It has increased to over 2000 e-volunteers spanning a wide range of locations and timezones, and continues to grow every day. These volunteers apply their diverse skills and interests to an equally varied array of projects.</p>
      <iframe frameborder=0 style='width:100%;height:500px' src="d4d-volunteer-map.html">
      </iframe>
      <p>With the expansion of Data For Democracy, we're working to develop a more cohesive structure and set of guidelines to better support volunteers in learning, working, and leading projects while remaining committed to our mission of producing data projects that have a positive and tangible impact on the world.</p>
      <p>That said, D4D is community-run! Anybody who wants to contribute to making D4D better is **highly** encouraged to do so! Everything in D4D thus far has come from grassroots ideas proposed and pushed forward by a community member and there's always more room for improvement. Whether it's starting a new project or proposing a new tool for the community to use, we encourage our members to just go for it!</p>
      <h3>Our goals</h3>
      <p>* To produce objective, rigorous data analysis that keeps people informed and engaged, and supports them in forming their independent opinions.</p>
      <p>* To connect with communities and partners that contribute to positive social change, and help equip them with the tools and technology to support the work they are already doing.</p>
      <p>* To make data science transparent and accessible to a wider audience, and create opportunities for passionate and socially conscious people to get involved with using data to serve the public good.</p>
